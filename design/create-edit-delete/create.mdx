# Creating

asdfasdf 

+ Resources that can be created through the console have a primary button called: **Create [resource-name]**
+ If a form exists, the form is shown by default
+ All forms should include an **Edit YAML** secondary action in the top right corner for users to optionally switch to YAML creation
+ If multiple creation types exists, the primary create button changes to **Create** and includes a dropdown to present the options
+ When creating a resource from the summary table view page, the create resource form/yaml is presented in-page
+ If creating a resource from another context, such as the topology view, these forms can be surfaced in a modal
+ Resources should have samples available on creation. When first viewing the form, the sample panel should be closed by default. When first viewing the YAML creation, the sample panel should be open by default.
